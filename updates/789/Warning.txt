 6. Using left and right button tune contrast to barely visible value (very dark). 
 7. Confirm it using middle button.

 9. Fine tune optimal contrast value and confirm it using middle button.

      *** Contrast note ***
     If you manage to set wrong contrast values you will need to open the vario and
     short RST and GND pads near gps module to restart factory test. 
     
     Alternativly you can place RST_FT on sd card
     or via Settings->Debug->Reset factory test
 
Peripheral detection
 1. SkyDrop will now check peripheral.
 
      *** GPS note ***
     New factory test will double check for GPS, if you have unfixed GPS 
     (You have vario from first batch), you wont be able to proceed.
     If you want to recover disassemble vario, remove battery and 
     copy older update files (0322) to sd card and reconnect battery.
    
 2. Press all three button, to confirm their functionality. 
    (Buzzer will play tones and led will lid)
 3. When all peripheral are found and checked (No line is blinking)
    test result and calibration values will be written into special memory and
    the vario will proceed with start-up sequence.
 4. All done :)
